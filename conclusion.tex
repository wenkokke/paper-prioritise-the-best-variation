\paragraph{On GV}

\paragraph{On deadlock freedom and progress in the $\pi$-calculus}
Deadlock freedom and progress have been studied thoroughly in the $\pi$-calculus with or without session types.

In the standard typed $\pi$-calculus a foundational line of work is by Kobayashi and his original type-theoretic approach to deadlock-freedom~\cite{kobayashi98}, where priorities are abstract tags defined over a partially ordered set. Later on these abstract tags were simplified to natural numbers, and pairs of obligations and capabilities were used in the type system for deadlock freedom~\cite{kobayashi02,kobayashi06}. This allowed more $\pi$-calculus processes to be typed. Following, Kobayashi's line of work, Padovani~\cite{padovani13} adapted obligation/capability pairs to session types, and later on he further simplified them to a single priority for linear $\pi$-calculus~\cite{padovani14}. As discussed by the author, by using the encoding of session types into linear types~\cite{kobayashi07,dardhagiachino12,dardha14beat,dardha16}, the deadlock freedom technique of the linear $\pi$-calculus with priorities can be transferred onto the $\pi$-calculus with session types.

The groundbreaking work on progress for session-typed $\pi$-calculus, by Dezani \emph{et al.}~\cite{dezani-ciancaglinimostrous06}, guarantees progress by allowing only one active session at a time. In~\cite{dezani-ciancagliniliguoro09progress} the authors introduce a partial order on channels in line with Kobayashi's work~\cite{kobayashi98}. Carbone and Debois~\cite{carbonedebois10} define progress for session typed $\pi$-calculus in terms of a \emph{catalyser} used to provide a missing counterpart to a process, thus guaranteeing progress.
Carbone \emph{et al.}~\cite{carbonedardha14} studied further the use of catalysers and showed that progress is a compositional form of lock-freedom. As in~\cite{padovani14} the authors show that by using the encoding of session types~\cite{dardhagiachino12} and Kobayashi's obligations/capabilities, we can obtain progress in for session types. Vieira and Vasconcelos~\cite{vieiravasconcelos13} used single priorities and an abstract partial order to guarantee deadlock freedom in session-typed $\pi$-calculus.

\paragraph{On Curry-Howard correspondences}
The Curry-Howard correspondence between logic and types laid the foundation for functional programming~\cite{wadler12}. With the rise of linear logic~\cite{girard87} a Curry-Howard correspondence was established between linear logic and the linear $\pi$-calculus~\cite{abramsky94,bellinscott94}. With the rise of session types, a new correspondence between linear logic and the $\pi$-calculus was proposed first by Caires and Pfenning~\cite{cairespfenning10}, for dual intuitionistic linear logic (DILL), and later by Wadler~\cite{wadler12} for classical linear logic (CLL). The underlying language in both correspondences satisfy deadlock freedom by design, by forbidding cyclic connections via typing. Dardha and Gay follow Padovani's work~\cite{padovani14} and use priorities in CP to define a new calculus which is deadlock-free by design, based on classical linear logic~\cite{girard87}  and the Curry-Howard correspondence with session types~\cite{wadler12}. Dardha and P\'{e}rez~\cite{dardhaperez15} compare Kobayashi-style typing and CLL typing, and prove that CLL corresponds to Kobayashi's system with the restriction that only single cuts are allowed. Balzer \emph{et al.} study sharing~\cite{balzerpfenning17} and later on deadlock freedom~\cite{balzertoninho19} in session-typed $\pi$-calculus based on DILL. In~\cite{balzerpfenning17} types are either linear or shared with modal operators connecting them, which allows sharing, but not deadlock freedom. Later on in~\cite{balzertoninho19} types are enhanced with information regarding the order of acquiring resources, which guarantees deadlock freedom.

\paragraph{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper we presented Priority GV, which is a functional language with session types. We used priorities in session types, following Priority CP~\cite{dardhagay18} to guarantee deadlock freedom statically via our priority-based type system. We proved the progress property of PGV in \Cref{lem:pgv-closed-progress-confs}. We also presented an updated version of PCP, where we moved from commuting conversions to structural congruence in the reduction relation, thus remaining faithful to the reduction relation of the $\pi$-calculus. Finally, we presented an encoding of Priority CP to Pririty GV in \Cref{fig:pcp-to-pgv}. For this translation we proved that it is sound with respect to typing (\Cref{{lem:pcp-to-pgv-terms-preservation}}, \Cref{thm:pcp-to-pgv-confs-preservation}) and operational semantics, given by operational correspondence soundness (\Cref{thm:pcp-to-pgv-operational-correspondence-soundness}) and completeness (\Cref{thm:pcp-to-pgv-operational-correspondence-completeness}).

As future work we intend to define the inverse encoding from Priority GV to Priority CP...
