  abstract  = {We present Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP), a revised
                  interpretation of the "Proofs as Processes" correspondence
                  between linear logic and the π-calculus initially proposed by
                  Abramsky [1994], and later developed by Bellin and Scott
                  [1994], Caires and Pfenning [2010], and Wadler [2014], among
                  others. HCP mends the discrepancies between linear logic and
                  the syntax and observable semantics of parallel composition in
                  the π-calculus, by conservatively extending linear logic to
                  hyperenvironments (collections of environments, inspired by
                  the hypersequents by Avron [1991]). Separation of environments
                  in hyperenvironments is internalised by ⊗ and corresponds to
                  parallel process behaviour. Thanks to this property, for the
                  first time we are able to extract a labelled transition system
                  (lts) semantics from proof rewritings. Leveraging the
                  information on parallelism at the level of types, we obtain a
                  logical reconstruction of the delayed actions that Merro and
                  Sangiorgi [2004] formulated to model non-blocking I/O in the
                  π-calculus. We define a denotational semantics for processes
                  based on Brzozowski derivatives, and uncover that
                  non-interference in HCP corresponds to Fubini’s theorem of
                  double antiderivation. Having an lts allows us to validate HCP
                  using the standard toolbox of behavioural theory. We
                  instantiate bisimilarity and barbed congruence for HCP, and
                  obtain a full abstraction result: bisimilarity, denotational
                  equivalence, and barbed congruence coincide.},

  abstract  = {Process calculi based on logic, such as πDILL and CP, provide a
                  foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However,
                  in previous work, there is a mismatch between the rules for
                  constructing proofs and the term constructors of the
                  π-calculus: the fundamental operator for parallel composition
                  does not correspond to any rule of linear logic. Kokke et al.
                  (2019) introduced Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP),
                  which addresses this mismatch using hypersequents (collections
                  of sequents) to register parallelism in the typing judgements.
                  However, the step from CP to HCP is a big one. As of yet, HCP
                  does not have reduction semantics, and the addition of delayed
                  actions means that CP processes interpreted as HCP processes
                  do not behave as they would in CP. We introduce HCP-, a
                  variant of HCP with reduction semantics and without delayed
                  actions. We prove progress, preservation, and termination, and
                  show that HCP- supports the same communication protocols as
                  CP.},
