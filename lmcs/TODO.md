# TODO: discuss

- @Reviewer2: While I generally understand the use of priorities to rule out circular waiting dependency, I am unclear about what the invariants are that the type system maintains in terms of priorities. Also, I didn’t get a clear understanding of the handling of priorities when it comes to closures. With regard to the former, for example, I am unclear about what the precise relationship is between the priority of the sequent and those in the context. There seems to be some relationship that is imposed by typing, but I was unable to distill the pattern, nor have the authors properly explained this. Closures are really tricky, and the authors should devote more time and space to convincingly argue that the enforced treatment is correct. Ideally, there would be a discussion based on a number of examples, including one that would be ruled out by typing, so that the reader can get an understanding of what the key concerns are. The current treatment is short, with the only justification for the chosen treatment: ”Closures suspend communication, so T-Lam stores the priority bounds of the function body on the function type, and T-App restores them.”

  @elektra85: at this stage we cannot do the discussion section + examples. I think adding a couple of sentences in English would do. These should comment on the invariants wrt priorities and the relationship between priorities of the seq and context.
