# Changes for version 21.07


- We have added all related work for MPST that were suggested to us by the reviewers
- We rewrote the abstract and introduction clarifying deadlock freedom and the fact that our setting is binary session types (not MPST) and functional programming via GV.
- We updated our contributions following reviewers' suggestions (note that the reduction relation in Updated PCP has nothing to do with functions, PCP is a pi-calculus and by using structural cong as opposed to commuting conversions we are coming closer to the pi-calculus)
